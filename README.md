## Project Description

### 1. Project Functionality
In this project, CSS code is utilized to create conditions where page elements appear differently in normal viewing mode (user interface) compared to print mode (when the user intends to print). This CSS technique allows for hiding additional elements during print, offering flexibility for applications such as concealing extra details in printed sales invoices or adding a company seal to the print page.

### 2. Project Importance
Implementing this CSS-based print configuration provides websites with precise and aesthetically pleasing control over printed content. It empowers website administrators to optimize crucial information or visual details specifically for print, enhancing the overall print experience.
